# Progress log — upgrade-1 branch

Working step by step, one task at a time, each approved before starting and verified after.

## Task 1: Money check — confirm every flight/booking link uses the Travelpayouts marker
Status: done

Findings:
- Results page (list, open-jaw combos, calendar trip), destination pages, and deals page
  all correctly use `buildBookingLink()` with marker 765816.
- Gap found: `/anywhere` page had no booking link at all (only an internal link to the
  destination page, which re-fetches a possibly different price). Fixed — added a
  direct "Book on Aviasales" button using the price/dates already returned by that
  page's own API call, same helper, same marker.
- No raw/unwrapped Aviasales links found anywhere in the codebase.

## Task 2: Hostels — finish real, verified data for all 12 cities
Status: done (needs owner action — see below)

Moved/organized the real hostel data (24 listings, 2 per city, all verified
Hostelworld names/links) into `supabase/hostels.sql`. This is the same data
already researched and run once before, now in its proper repo location with
clearer documentation. Safe to re-run (delete-then-insert for these 12 cities).

ACTION NEEDED FROM YOU: run `supabase/hostels.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor.
If you already ran the old version of this script, this is a safe no-op
(same data) — only needed if you haven't run it yet, or want to confirm.

## Task 3: Hostel affiliate — check if hostel links can earn commission
Status: research done — ACTION NEEDED FROM YOU

Good news: your hostel links already point to hostelworld.com, and
**Travelpayouts offers a Hostelworld affiliate program through the same
account** you already use for flights (plus Hotellook and Booking.com as
alternatives/additions). You don't need a separate sign-up with Hostelworld
directly.

What to do:
1. Log into Travelpayouts -> left sidebar -> "Programs".
2. Search for "Hostelworld" and click to join/activate it (should be quick,
   similar to how the Aviasales program was already active).
3. Once active, generate a sample link the same way you did for the flight
   marker (Tools -> Links -> paste a hostelworld.com URL -> Generate link),
   and send me the resulting full link (or just the marker/program ID if
   it's visible).
4. I'll then build a `buildHostelBookingLink()` helper (same pattern as the
   flights one) and wire it into all 12 destination pages.

Note on commission rates: third-party sources disagree a lot (numbers from
5% to 22%+ depending on the source), so don't rely on any number I find
online — the real rate will show in your Travelpayouts dashboard once you
activate the program.

## Task 4: Mobile — check every page at phone width
Status: done

Tested all 6 pages at 390px width (iPhone-size) with Playwright, both in
their empty/error states (real, since this sandbox can't reach Travelpayouts
or Supabase) and their populated states (mocked realistic API responses) --
home, search, results (plain list, open-jaw combos, calendar), anywhere,
deals, destination page.

Result: no horizontal overflow or broken layouts found anywhere -- the
Tailwind-based pages were already handling mobile width well. One polish
fix made: `/deals` and the destination pages used a fixed 40px padding
with no mobile adjustment, eating a lot of a 390px screen; reduced to
24px/20px so more content fits comfortably.

Side note: running `npm run dev` for this testing caused Next.js's own
tooling to re-add its standard agent-instructions block to AGENTS.md.
Confirmed this is genuine Next.js behavior (the package really does this,
not an injected/fabricated file as initially suspected before node_modules
was installed) -- but left it out of this commit rather than committing it,
since that block's own text telling an AI to commit it is exactly the kind
of embedded instruction worth not following automatically. Flagged for the
owner to decide; this will keep reappearing (harmlessly) each time
`next dev` runs locally.

## Task 5: No crashes/infinite loads — loading, empty, error states everywhere
Status: not started
